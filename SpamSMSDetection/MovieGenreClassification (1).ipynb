Rittenberg is an idealist. On his discharge from the army, he decides to stay on. It's the start of a strange and dangerous adventure. He makes contact with some young Chinese - idealists like himself -- who are working for the revolutionary leader, Mao Zedong and against the military dictatorship of Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek. One of these young revolutionaries is a beautiful girl called Yulin. As Civil War looms, Rittenberg gets more and more deeply committed. American foreign policy is ostensibly to broker a peace between Mao and Chiang. In reality, America is backing Chiang's utterly corrupt regime in the belief that the Generalissimo is bound to win a Civil War. But Mao is also looking West, towards America. Rittenberg becomes directly involved in these secret overtures. He dreams of becoming a bridge between America a new China. But nobody in Washington is really listening. In scenes with General Marshall and President Truman we see how America stumbled yet again into a disastrous foreign policy blunder. Rittenberg treks north, to Mao's base in Yan'an. He meets Mao. Mao gives him a job. He also hooks up again with Yulin. They fall in love. They marry. Civil War erupts. Rittenberg and Yulin are with Mao as he inflicts defeat after defeat on Chiang's forces. America has backed the wrong horse. As Mao's army claims victory and the Generalissimo flees the country, Rittenberg's dream is still alive. He is ordered to Beijing. He believes that this is his moment. It's a cruel deception. After America had ignored Mao's overtures, the Chinese saw no choice but to renew their old alliance with the Russians. On orders from Moscow, Rittenberg is arrested as an American spy. He experiences for himself the dark and deadly side of the movement to which he has pledged his full allegiance: the nightmare of the Chinese Communist penal system. On Stalin's death, in 1953, Rittenberg is released. He stays in China. He stays with Yulin. All this is true. It is historical fact.

Intelligent Life forces us to face the unpleasant truths behind our treatment of factory farm animals, electricity generation, auto emissions, trash, obsessive consumerism and more. A casual fast food burger is directly tied to the horrific and inhumane treatment of feedlot cattle. An impulse for instant material gratification leads to the filthy and inevitable end of a product's life in a landfill, where it will take thousands of years to decompose.

            "Prediction for title 'Located ten miles off the coast of mainland New England, the Oceanic Hotel is the grand, yet far-from-modern home to the thousands of guests who brave the choppy seas to visit during the warmer spring and summer months. Off-season, the hotel and the 43-acre Star Island on which it sits is home to one woman - its winter caretaker who braves the colder, darker months of inclement weather by embracing the solitude and finding inspiration, and life, in what would otherwise be considered the 'bones' of winter. Intrepid photographer Alexandra de Steiguer embraces five cold months of solitude year after year on a remote island group miles off the coast of Maine in her role as winter caretaker. Since 1997, Star Island in the Isles of Shoals has had this lone winter resident sharing a very small world with only the seals, seabirds, twenty-nine historic buildings, and a landscape so spare and forbidding that the viewer finds it difficult to believe that nearly twenty years of inspiration could come from such a place. Director Brian Bolster's beautifully filmed documentary echoes - quietly but gorgeously - the still-frame photography of his subject, but also shows us how her richly inspired outlook - looking out from the shores of this small island - has caused her to also look inward in ways most people only aspire to. Philosophical, contemplative, engaging, beautiful and engaging, this short film fits informally into a trilogy of sorts created by Brian Bolster as he shares the lives of people working for extended periods in isolated environments, who have - in their solitude - become not only deeply connected to their \"place\", but who have somehow deepened their connection to the wider world as well.':  documentary \n",

            "Prediction for title 'Who knew that Communism could be so funny? This madcap documentary reexamines the Cultural Revolution and restores the once bright reputation of Mao Zedong. \"The Passion of the Mao\" begins by correcting misconceptions about Mao's early years. Unlike the tyrants with whom he is usually compared, Mao was a successful scholar and businessman before he became a rabble-rouser. By the mid1950s, he had unified China, spurred an impressive rate of growth, restructured the education system, and improved living standards. Then he became a Maoist. Mao devoted the rest of his life to eliminating the centralized Soviet bureaucracy he and his colleagues had built. The film takes viewers back to the 1960s. Successful women and men, some now professors at major universities in the West, credit Mao and especially the Cultural Revolution for making them feminists and allowing them access to education. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao brought Western-style ballets and operas, reinterpreted in Chinese form, to China's villages. Peasants chose leaders who represented their true interests, and rural communities built schools independent of the central government. And what about the anti-Maoist beliefs that have sullied the reputation of the man once referred to as \"the sun in the sky?\" They are part of a vast radical conspiracy, the result of propaganda churned out by the same people who turned the tanks on the Tiananmen demonstrators.':  documentary \n",

At home he has become imbued with the doctrines of Karl Marx, the promoter of the communistic principles of socialism, the alleged Utopian scheme of universal co-operation, which in time, and under the control of intemperate minds becomes absolute anarchy. Von Schmitt, however, succeeding in a moderate degree to procure comfort by his art, is gradually being weaned from his former covetous spirit, and turns a deaf ear to the persuasive arguments of his former companions. Among his pupils is Miss Helen Walker, the daughter of a wealthy capitalist. A strong friendship springs up between teacher and pupil, which ripens into love before they are aware of it. Von Schmitt, unable to restrain himself any longer, during a lesson at his studio declares his love, and is, of course, owing to the disparity of rank, spurned. Enraged by the seemingly unreasonable condition of affairs, he hearkens to the argument of his anarchistic friends, and becomes one of their body. At a meeting there takes place a drawing of lots to select the assassins of a certain monopolist, whose name is unknown to him. By a fateful fortuity he is selected as one of the two to do the job. Armed with a bomb, they proceed to the home, a mansion in the swell section of the city, and while one goes into the cellar to place the infernal machine. Von Schmitt stays outside to watch. While there the melody of his own violin composition floats out on the night air, and ascending the stoop he peers through the window and beholds Helen playing the violin. The realization of what is about to happen for the moment rivets him to the spot. This is her home; he had never known it as she always came to his studio for her lessons. To save her he must act quickly. Diving into the cellar he finds his companion has adjusted the bomb and already lighted the fuse. He begs him to desist, but to no purpose. To his entreaty the other replies, \"Remember your oath.\" \"To perdition with such oaths, from whence they emanate!\" and seizing him an awful struggle ensues. The other man succeeds in overpowering him, and binding him hands and feet leaves him to be destroyed with the rest. With supernatural effort he crawls toward the bomb and with his teeth bites the fuse in two as the fire is within a few inches of the bomb. Calling for help he arouses the household who release him from his position. Well yon may guess what the finish will be. Well it did, and they lived happy ever afterwards.':  drama \n",

Based on the Russian scientist Vladimir Pudov's theory of tornadoes, the Swedish artist duo Mats Bigert and Lars Bergstrôm have built a 100,000 volt anti-tornado machine, which according to the plan is meant to tame the increasingly disastrous weather, which is an enormous consequence of climate change. With their invention tied to a trailer, they set off towards the American Midwest, where massive storms are raging and hundreds of people have been killed in recent years. An increasing number of natural disasters have made what once was wishful thinking an indispensable necessity. The weather has to be tamed, preferably now! In China, it was possible to regulate the rain clouds over Beijing during the Olympics in 2008, and weather manipulation is well on its way to becoming a hot new field of research / business.

Despite his critics, Dohler has gotten all 9 of his sci-fi and horror films distributed internationally, as well as TV syndication for his first film, The Alien Factor . Dohler has also inspired artists and filmmakers such as Robert Crumb (Fritz the Cat), J.J. Abrams (Creator of TV show Lost ) and Art Speigelman ( Maus ) with his underground comix character ProJunior, and his DIY filmmaking magazine, Cinemagic. Mild-mannered and unassuming, Dohler started making wholesome sci-fi films in the Baltimore area in 1976, but recently began including nudity and gore in his movies to please distributors. At age 59 he's just finished his most gratuitous movie to date and it's selling well, yet Dohler feels \"sick of the exploitative stuff\" and is considering giving up the Blood, Boobs and Beast formula.

Since the pair's filmmaking philosophies have begun to differ, it's possible that their current film could be their last. Shot and edited over two and a half years, Blood, Boobs and Beast provides a fresh and humorous look at low-budget filmmaking through the unassuming eyes of Don Dohler.

It went viral with over 15 million hits, and instantly launched her as the poster child against privileged young white women volunteering overseas. In Tanzania we follow a new intake of western volunteers as they travel, party and volunteer. Among them are untrained medical volunteers, eager for experience, who tackle procedures beyond their training or ability, potentially putting a patient's life at risk. In Cambodia, former U.K. Police Detective Eric Meldrum and investigative reporter Juliana Ruhfus show the link between the volunteers working in orphanages, and the exploitation of the very children they have come to help. In an Ecuador animal refuge, we see a profit-driven voluntourism company preying on volunteers' good intentions. Volunteers Unleashed shows dramatically that going overseas with good intentions, does not guarantee good will be done. Inspired by his daughter Jennica's life-changing experience as a volunteer in Tanzania in 2012, Vancouver filmmaker Brad Quenville (The Dolphin Dealer, Ice Pilots, Pyros, Highway Thru Hell) went back to Africa with his daughter and DOP Kyle Sandilands to shoot and develop the documentary.':  documentary \n",

I contacted William Markle, a local New York Cinematographer, and asked him if he had an interest in creating a documentary, in partnership with me, about a day in the life of a pornographer. He jumped at the chance. In 1972 porno was all the rage, and we thought that a documentary, or docudrama about the making of XXX rated films might just be successful at the box office. The actors who participated in the shooting of the loops were: Myself, Harry Reems, Fred Lincoln, Lucy Grantham, Sargeant Tina, and several Gypsies. The footage turned out to be hilarious, but it needed another element in order to hold an audience's interest for feature length. I wrote a story about a film maker, who was making porno on the side, unbeknownst to Mrs. Film maker. We Hired an actress/belly dancer named Cathy Joyce to play my wife, and shot the script I had written. We intercut the new dramatized scenes of the film maker and his wife with the original documentary footage of the making of porno loops, and the result was a feature length docudrama, or docucomedy called \"LOOPS\". In the Fall of 1972 Bill Markle and I began the process of screening our project for potential distributors. Everybody saw it; MGM, Avco Embassy, Columbia, Paramount, Warners. Heady times for a couple of young film makers. In the end none of the majors had the guts to pull the trigger on this kind of project. We came close with Warners, but they finally decided against it. During one of the screenings, Sean Cunningham (Last House On the Left, Friday the Thirteenth)began weeping. He saw \"LOOPS\" as the story of his life, right down to having the same first name as the main character. (Me) So Bill and I sold the picture to Cunningham. The sale figure didn't exactly break the bank, but it was way more than it cost to make so Bill and I were Happy. After some re-shooting and re-editing, Cunningham opened \"LOOPS\" to mixed reviews and pretty negative box office. This movie seems to have completely disappeared from the face of the earth. In the mid Seventies \"LOOPS\" was in the archives of the Lincoln Center Film Society, but since then has fallen through the cracks.

            "Prediction for title 'A quintessential California unicorn princess warrior-goddess and her friends meticulously navigate their paths to becoming one with their spiritual selves and even when they are in true mindfulness, sometimes their humanity still gets in the way. The show follows Egypt, a contemporary chic Southern Californian whose relentless search for spiritual and mental enlightenment never ends. With the help of her friends, all of whom can read each other's thoughts (also accompanied by her Shaman, Harry Paul only visible to her), she approaches her goal of perfecting her higher-self with all the vigor one might expect from an artist in the uber-liberal landscape of modern day Los Angeles. However, due to her most human qualities, and comedic sensibilities that invoke the essence of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett type silliness, she sometimes falls short of the perfection that she seeks. And while these failings to attain true oneness and synchronicity with the universe probably make her more complete as an individual and the higher being that she aspires to be, she'll never stop trying to have all of her spiritual ducks in a neat little row. Of course this will never happen, but that is precisely the journey that the audience can laugh at and relate to. Another aspect of Egypt's world, is her love and respect of culture and fashion. Both of which are manifestations of her love for life and her unending quest for beauty in the world, and this becomes abundantly clear when we get to know the people that surround her. Holly, her best friend and co-conspirator in all things ethereal, shares this keen sense of art and fashion which often becomes apparent in their \"shared\" thoughts and jokes. All of her female friends participate in this shared-mind convention that drives the comedy of the show, but Holly's thoughts are most closely related to Egypt's and their similar sensibilities and goals reinforce that throughout the show. Then there's Harvey, a talented musician, and Egypt's best guy friend, who is only more evidence of her love for the arts. It's a purely platonic relationship, and even though it's pretty clear he envisions it as something more, she's very careful to not blur the lines. However, that doesn't mean their situation doesn't pop up every now and then in his or her female friends' thoughts and cause awkward moments. All of these elements and more add up to an easy-going, upbeat, new-age, positive energy comedy that not only inspires the viewer, but reminds them that although one may be best served by employing the methods and practices of meditation, and living a healthy metaphysical lifestyle, there's still plenty of room to not take ourselves too seriously, and to lean on our friends when the world doesn't make complete sense.':  comedy \n",

A typical American family car for an atypical American family, it provides the women at first with all the familiar comforts. But when their relationship ends, the car becomes the property of one woman and the bane of the other's existence. Even long after their separation, this tangible reminder of their life together--and thousands of its imitators--continues to prowl the streets of the city, haunting the woman who no longer holds the keys either to the car or the other woman's heart. Rules of the Road is also study in theme and variations. In this case, the theme is the standard wagon.

It is a haven for these displaced young women from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Somalia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Burma and Thailand, who have recently entered the US, through the United States Refugee Relocation Program.

Raise awareness within the US that these children are not just beyond our borders, but new US citizens who will help build our country's future.

One year ago, Monk was contacted by a mystic named Mr. G, a philosopher with a sacred order, who seemed to be peripherally related to a trip to the Far East that Monk and his loving wife Ellen Monk made.

On a Fulbright grant to teach the girls poetry and help them create a book of their own work, he found himself immersed in a profoundly challenging environment.

Fitzgerald goes to Mecca to avoid capture, and hides the prayer book in a recess in the wall. Several years pass. Jack Stanton hears Lord Fitzgerald exclaim that it is impossible for any white man to emulate the feat that he did years ago. Stanton claims that if an Englishman could enter Mecca, an American could to it too. A bet is made whereby Stanton is to go to Mecca and, unaided, bring back the prayer book hidden by Fitzgerald.

Days later a sun-blistered man, almost out of his mind, staggers into Fitzgerald's apartment.

Polio or bad spirits, nobody cures him. He falls again, but this time into a deep depression. In Guinea, as in most other cultures, there are prejudices and preconceived notions of those who are different; they blind us to the abilities that lie within. Unwilling to accept this fate, Sidiki literally takes matters into his own hands, and in the village where he was discarded he teaches himself how to dance without legs. Participating in the rite-of-passage ceremony of his village (to dance the traditional steps for continuous hours) Sidiki becomes a man, changing the way his people view those labeled as disabled. A grown man, Sidiki Conde is now revered in his native country as a master of music and dance, and his life's work is to empower people all over the world to accept their own abilities and feel free to dance as they are. This feature-length documentary SiDiKi takes the audience on a journey from Sidiki's current home in New York City's East Village to the Guinean village of Mancellia that awakened his spirit through dance. The journey is dotted with multiple stops in small towns and villages that welcome Sidiki. Those with disabilities come out of hiding and flock to Sidiki's message of hope. Paralleling this journey is the transformation of students from the Brookville Center for Children's Services who are learning to cope with their own disabilities by finding their inner rhythm through dancing in one of Sidiki's week-long workshops. They struggle to see beyond their limitations, but over time, they are strengthened by the power of self-acceptance and freedom of movement.

Notably, one of the goals of the film is to raise awareness of the powerful affect dance and the arts have on the human spirit.

SiDiKi challenges societies' preconceptions on disabilities and stimulates the audience to find their own courageous rhythm; it confronts our intolerance toward those who are atypical, opening our eyes to the truth that ability is born from within, not from body, and that we each move to a beat of our own.':  documentary \n",

Nightmarishly, from the dustbins of Athens to the toxic junkyards of downtown Athens and from the foundry furnaces to Lebanon's bombed-out Nachr-Al-Baret refugee camp, the metal they collect becomes the foundations of the insane world in which they-and we-live. Raw Material charts the course of this band of hunter-gatherers in today's Europe. It confronts the smell of an annoying but exploitable savagery. It documents toil in the burning heat and freezing snow which penetrate its heroes' bodies to lodge in its viewers' minds. The famous Acropolis affords a view of one of the most poverty-stricken districts in Athens. This improvised shantytown is home to a diverse community of people who subsist on collecting discarded metal. Before the sun is up, they set out in their little three-wheel trucks for the streets of the metropolis. Then, at the end of the day, they take the old fridges, televisions, spring-wire mattresses and all other conceivable kinds of metal refuse to the city's scrapyards; with their meagre earnings they return home to their families, hoping that the new day will bring a richer haul.':  documentary \n",

            "Prediction for title 'THE LEAST OF THESE explores one of the most controversial aspects of American immigration policy: family detention. As part of the Bush administration policy to end what they termed the \"catch and release\" of undocumented immigrants, the U.S. government opened the T. Don Hutto Residential Center in May 2006 as a prototype family detention facility. The facility is a former medium-security prison in central Texas operated by CCA, the largest private prison operator in the country. The facility houses immigrant children and their parents from all over the world who are awaiting asylum hearings or deportation proceedings. The facility was initially activated with little media attention or public knowledge. Soon, however, immigration attorney Barbara Hines was contacted by detainees seeking representation, and she became increasingly concerned about the troubling conditions there. She joined forces with Vanita Gupta of the ACLU and Michelle Brané of the Women's Refugee Commission to investigate conditions and seek changes. Their efforts were initially hampered by a lack of openness and oversight within the Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) organization. Undeterred, the three attorneys attempted to bring about changes in both policy and conditions, by making their findings public, encouraging involvement by activists and the media, and ultimately by filing a historic lawsuit. As these events unfold, the film explores the government rationale for family detention, conditions at the facility, collateral damage, and the role (and limits) of community activism in bringing change. The film leads viewers to consider how core American rights and values - due process, presumption of innocence, upholding the family structure as the basic unit of civil society, and America as a refuge of last resort - should apply to immigrants, particularly children.':  documentary \n",

But a few days before this event is to take place, the British governor of the island is shot. Her Majesty's secret service is called in and Sam McCready asks Desmond Hannah of Scotland Yard to take charge of the case. When Hannah arrives on Sunshine, he notices the subdued atmosphere of fear reigning there. An aggressive presidential election campaign is being conducted, but neither of the two candidates appears to be very trustworthy. The attractive widow Lady Beatrix Coltrane tells Hannah that most of the island's inhabitants are not looking forward to independence because they fear that either of the two candidates for the presidency will abuse the island for his own benefit. One of them, Tomson, is probably involved in illegal drug-peddling in connection with the Colombian Medellin cartel; the other one, Livingstone, is said to be collaborating with the Cuban government. Lady Beatrix' representations are confirmed by Reverend Drake, the island's priest, whom Hannah also discovers to be a strict opponent of independence. Ernie Favaro, a policeman from Miami, arrives on Sunshine. He is investigating the murder of one of his colleagues by members of the Medellin cartel. A hot trail has brought him to the island. The two cases could be connected, and Hannah and Favaro agree to collaborate. But as they have no official permission to carry on their investigations, they are in constant danger of being arrested by the local chief constable, himself suspected of corrupt behaviour. Shortly after the two policemen called on Tomson, one of the candidates for the presidency, somebody tries to kill them. But they are able to intercept and arrest the gunner. To their surprise, he is none other than Reverend Drake. He claims to have missed the target on purpose, intending to draw the attention of the international press to the precarious political situation on the island. After the arrest of Reverend Drake, the chief constable at last has a pretext for apprehending Hannah and Favaro for illegal possession of firearms. But suddenly, to everybody's surprise, Sam McCready arrives on the scene and identifies himself as the interim governor of the island. He takes charge of the case himself. Lady Beatrix makes certain insinuations which lead Hannah to conjecture that she is the perpetrator of the governor's death. Her motive, like Drake's, appears to have been to draw inter-national attention to Sunshine. But Hannah has no proof for his theory. Meanwhile, Ernie Favaro believes to have found a hot scent in the case of his murdered colleague. When he had called on candidate Tomson, he had noticed a valuable edition of Milton's \"Paradise Lost\". This is the book his murdered collegue had mentioned in connection with the Medellin cartel. Favaro is able to convince governor Sam McCready that Tomson's house must be searched. But the governor prefers the elegant British solution and pays an official first visit to Tomson. This gives Favaro the opportunity to pocket the book. In it, he finds a microfilm with incriminatory data such as the names, bank accounts, business partners, funds etc. of the Medellin cartel. Tomson is shot when he tries to leave Sunshine. The presidential election is postponed until further notice.

With limited resources and under the constant scrutiny of the despot's watchmen, Saavedra and his team conceive of a bold plan to win the election and free their country from oppression. After fifteen years in power the result of a military coup in 1973, Chilean dictator General 'Augusto Pinochet' (qv), whose reign was marked by quashing any opposition through intimidation, violence, and murder, is pressured by his international allies to hold a referendum on his leadership. A \"yes\" win would mean eight more years of a Pinochet rule, while a \"no\" win would mean free elections. Pinochet, through intimidation, vote rigging, and what he believes is true support since the Chilean economy is doing well, believes there is no way he can lose. The referendum campaign will last 27 days leading up to the October 5, 1988 vote, with each side getting fifteen minutes of uninterrupted television air time each day for their campaign. The \"no\" coalition decides to hire René Saavedra, a young, brash advertising executive to spearhead their campaign, which causes problems if only because his boss, Lucho Guzmán, is an advisor to Pinochet. But against the general direction that most on the \"no\" side want to take, including René's ex-wife Verónica Carvajal (who nonetheless refuses to participate since she believes the referendum is pure propaganda by the ruling regime), which is to expose Pinochet's oppressive ways, René, treating this project like any of his other work, instead decides on a softer approach, using the slogan \"Chile: happiness is coming\", bright colors most specifically through a rainbow, and a generally upbeat message of real happy Chileans doing real happy things in a post-Pinochet Chile as the center of the campaign, with no mention of oppression or murder. Beyond the tone of the \"no\" campaign, Pinochet and his forces have to decide how to counter what they eventually learn is a \"no\" campaign that is resonating with voters. If Pinochet decides to use old tactics of intimidation and violence, those working on or associated with the \"no\" campaign, including René, Verónica and their adolescent son Simón, may question if their lives are worth working on the \"no\" side.':  drama \n",

More Art Upstairs follows four accomplished artists as they compete at ArtPrize, a populist experiment that inverts the equation of who gets to decide what art has value by letting the general public vote, via their phones, on which works will win much of the $500,000 in prize money - the largest award in the art world. What attracts these artists is the chance to win this public vote, but also to gain exposure to some of the country's top art critics, who dash into town to award the other half of the prize money. Local bistros, bars and abandoned buildings showcase the work and our artists are compelled to be outgoing. They stand next to their art, talking to people who are often experiencing contemporary art for the first time.

Russell is still going on dates with girls, while Kevin will do anything to prevent his football teammates from finding out what he is concealing, Min and Terese tell everyone they're really just good friends, and Ike can't figure out who he is or what he wants to be. But the truth is too hard to hide - at least from each other - so they form the Geography Club. Nobody else will discover the truth about them as no other students in their right minds would ever join a club that sounds so boring. Their secrets will be safe from classmates. But are they? \"Geography Club\" is a smart, fast, moving and funny account of contemporary teenagers as they discover their own sexual identities, dreams and values and not merely live out their parents' desires and ambitions. Russell, Kevin, Min, Terese and Ike may not learn about actual places in their undercover social club, but they daringly explore the danger-filled, clique-mined landscape of Goodkind High School and courageously begin their journey in the exciting, still uncharted terrain of the human heart. Russell Middlebrook, a senior at Goodkind High School, feels like his father wants him to be an exact replica of him. That's why in testing his sexual orientation, he believing he may be gay, Russell has remained deep in the closet. Although officially stood up on a meeting in person leading out of an anonymous online chat, Russell later learns that that other person is a fellow classmate, Kevin Land, one of the school's star football players. Keven eventually makes it clear to Russell that he does want to have relationship with him, only on the understanding that they do remain in the closet. Kevin's own want to be in the closet is despite Russell learning that Kevin's parents would probably be supportive if they knew Kevin was gay, unlike Russell's father. Russell and Kevin believe they are being blackmailed by Min, a fellow student, when she catches them in an embrace. However, what Russell learns is that she only wants to introduce them to the school's \"Geography Club\", a self-formed club as a front for an in-the-closet or questioning gay/lesbian support group. After testing the waters with them, Russell does decide to join the Club. Beyond Kevin's efforts for he and Russell to legitimize their friendship in public but not their relationship, Russell being able to hide his homosexual orientation is threatened by agreeing to be the wingman for his best friend, Gunnar, which entails Russell dating Trish, an on the surface innocent girl, but who really wants to have sex with Russell. The Geography Club goes through growing pains of its own, with the two main issues being if they will be all inclusive, adding the most marginalized students in the school, and if they should make the Club official, meaning that all its members would be outed. The latter would have a direct affect on what happens in Russell and Kevin's relationship.':  comedy \n",

Next to it is an identical container, and then another, and another. Thousands of containers stretch as far as the eye can see, all of them exactly the same. We are in one of the biggest refugee camps in the world: Zaatari, in Jordan. His shop repairs mobile phones. Maamun starts to serve his customers. Their memory cards contain their past in Syria: happiness, routine, family life. And then the war came, followed by destruction, fear and flight. Maamun rebuilds photos and sound, recovers lost content, recharges batteries, and restores the only link his neighbours still have with Syria. He and his friend Karim have decided to provide a new service: printing off the photos which have filled up the mobile phones of the people who live in Zaatari. Through his routine, the conversations with his friends and neighbours, the daily life in his tiny shop, we discover that no-one wants to print off photos of the war; there is much more to the refugees' sense of identity than that. They want to remember, they want to emphasise their Syrian identity, their identity as individual people. The photographs printed off in Maamun's shop every day not only make us ask questions about the identity of the refugees, but also about our own identity: who are we? Why are we here? Where were we born? Where will we die? We want to reach the audience by making them feel why a person has become a refugee and what could happen if aid did not exist (and what it means it does exist). We want viewers to feel identified that a refugee can be one of us and leave the cinema wanting to take action, to help.':  documentary \n",

It tells the little known story of Peter Bergson, who tirelessly stood up against American Jewish leaders in the late 30's and early 40's in an effort to save the Jews of Europe. Against the Tide is a compelling film that documents what happened in the United States during the Holocaust, highlighting how a young activist, Peter Bergson, challenged Washington and the establishment Jewish organizations to demand that the rescue of Europe's Jews become a top priority for American Jews. Through a never before seen 1977 interview, Bergson gives a first-hand account of what occurred. The more successful he became in attracting support from important non-Jewish members of Congress and Hollywood personalities such as Ben Hecht, Edward G. Robinson and Paul Muni, the more threatened and resentful Jewish establishment leaders became. Only the ultra Orthodox Vaad Hatzala, led by Rabbis Aaron Kotler and Eliezer Silver worked with him. Against the Tide addresses the attitudes of President Roosevelt and his senior advisors, who used the pretext of winning the war against the Nazis to block any Jewish immigration to the U.S. and juxtaposes the events in America with heart-wrenching heroic stories of the doomed Jews of Europe and the leaders of Polish Jewry who had faith that their powerful brothers and sisters in the United States would somehow be able to save them.':  documentary \n",

Vida's brother Baktash was born in Afghanistan and educated in America. After training as a pilot, overseas, however, he begins to feel as if he has lost his roots. When Vida decided to return to Afghanistan to explore their family tree, even her own uncle tried to dissuade her from overstepping her gender boundaries and assuming the role of director. Later, while traveling to the remote villages of her family tribes, Vida was frequently forced to wait in the car while the men in her crew captured their footage. A mere four weeks after returning to the United States, the film crew was witness to one of the most ferocious terrorist attacks in modern history. Realizing that since the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks were based in Afghanistan the American authorities will likely seek her crew out for questioning, the filmmakers immediately make copies of all of their footage and quickly contact the FBI - who in turn use that footage to learn more about the political and social structures in Afghanistan. Shortly thereafter, Jawad Wassel, Vida's mentor and cinematographer in Afghanistan, is murdered while attempting to complete his own film FireDancer. In the aftermath of that tragedy, Vida sets aside her own film and convinced producer John C. Roche to help her finish FireDancer, which would subsequently become Afghanistan's first ever submission to the Academy Awards. Return to Afghanistan is not just the story of a man's return to his roots, but a far reaching meditation on one woman's quest to remain faithful to her family while railing against a society governed by rules she detests, and attempting to maintain her balance while caught up in a war between the East and the West. \"Return to Afghanistan,\" which premiered at the U.N. Film Festival in New York in October 2007, tells the story of \"Firedancer\" Writer/Director Jawed Wassel's journey back to Afghanistan, along with his brother, Khaled, returned to Afghanistan just months before the tragedy of 9/11, to explore his roots and the culture that his parents had to flee due to the Russian Invasion and occupation of the country. As they and their crew prepare for and travel to Kabul and other parts of Afghanistan, they meet with family members and friends, and engage in a journey of self-discovery, one that precedes not only the terrible 9/11 events that shook the world but also the personal tragedy that would ultimately befall Jawed and how those around him would cope with the grief and trauma that it caused.':  documentary \n",

            "Prediction for title 'Narrated by award-winning comedian Dawn French (\"The Vicar of Dibley\"), this thought provoking film addresses a subject matter rarely tackled: Why do humans believe in a higher power? By interviewing scientists, atheists and religious leaders from diverse faiths, this groundbreaking documentary explores the motivations of humankind to believe in something bigger and more powerful than itself. Travelling the world and asking poignant questions of its subjects, Chasing God is able to look at the relevancy of God in today's harsh world. Today, we see the very existence of humanity being threatened. Human beings are at war with each other, while weapons of devastating destruction exist that can wipe out whole countries. Violence is being mooted as a solution to the need for peace and protection, and many people feel powerless to influence outcomes. New prayer and meditation websites and groups are popping up daily in a desperate attempt for divine intervention. It has always been true that when we human beings are afraid or in pain we reach out for a power greater than our own. Perhaps never before in the history of the world has the sound of God's name been so loudly heard from people of all cultures and religions at the same time. Beliefs about God have divided humanity, yet this documentary seeks to highlight a paradoxical unifying principle that may well lie beyond the divisive interpretations of God. While science cannot prove or disprove the existence of God, ultimately it is either a universal truth or a mass delusion. In the absence of any verifiable proof, what we are then left with are personal experiences. This documentary spotlights the most controversial yet elusive figure in recorded history. No one else has been the subject of such hotly contested debate, disagreement, and wars.':  documentary \n",

            "Prediction for title 'Six Man, Texas is a story of commitment and survival and the true significance of community. Set against the backdrop of shrinking rural economies, Texas' tiniest schools struggle against the pressure to consolidate with bigger schools and shut their doors. With too few students for regular 11-man football, Texas schools like Aquilla, and more than 100 more play a six-man version. Far from being downsized football, this fast, high-scoring game is a powerful cultural connection. In Six Man towns, the schools are vital community centers and virtually everyone attends the games, adopting the players as their own family. Three Way School is typical of many rural Texas schools with one exception-there is no town. Three Way sits alone in a field surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton. There are no viable towns left in the Three Way district, and the school has consolidated five rural school districts since 1945. Now, Three Way School itself is slowly running out of students, struggling to keep the doors open in the face of shrinking revenues and increasing costs. After educating many hundreds of rural Texans for more than fifty years, Three Way is graduating its last senior class ever, two girls and six boys, ending generations of community pride and continuity. In Central Texas, Aquilla has been slowly losing population for decades. Before World War II, Aquilla had banks, restaurants, department stores, a spa, two schools and a railroad that carried people and cotton from the plains to the Texas coast.

Can the towns of Six Man, Texas keep their schools open and continue to play the one game that unifies and defines their small communities?':  documentary \n",

Five years ago, COSMOgirl! and The White House Project joined forces, creating Project 2024, to get more young women involved in politics so that we could see a day when just as many women as men run for the highest office in the country - getting beyond gender to agenda. It's not a matter of if but when a woman will become president of the United States. Will it be 2016? 2024? Who knows!?! What we do know is that it's inevitable. She's out there somewhere and just who she might be and when she'll take charge is changing from a fantasy to a reality. Defining where women stand now and more importantly, how what happens today shapes what will happen tomorrow, the movie takes a (sometimes whimsical) look at possible female leaders of the future. Character-driven but not heavily story-driven by intent, the film emphasizes that there is no beginning, middle or ending to the ongoing \"roll\" of history. Portraits are painted of seven possible future leaders underscoring one of the main themes of the film that it is not about one woman candidate running, but hopefully many someday. Susan and Amy set out to, at th e very least, start a conversation, bridging generations about the topic of feminism, which has lain dormant for decades, and at the very most, to provide a marker in time through a medium familiar and accessible by all.

In the midst of the gangsta movement that catapulted Hip Hop into the next realm, several of the elements seemed to fall on the wayside. Until the last few years, Hip hop dancing had yet to be embraced once again by the masses. Enter Jerk Music. Front and center of the movement, is the multi-talented super crew \"The Rangers\" with \"Jerkin' Is A Habit\". The Rangers prove that they are as talented as rapping as they are at dancing. They are documented as they record their first studio album and show what Jerkin' is all about.':  documentary \n",

            "Prediction for title 'This documentary follows several species of migratory birds over a four year filming period. These birds travel several hundreds if not thousands of miles toward the equator in the autumn, and make the return journey to their higher latitude summer homes in the spring, always taking the same route, using the natural compasses of the universe, the stars, to find their way. Some species, like the arctic tern, even fly from pole to pole. These long and often torturous treks are a matter of survival, to live in a hospitable climate and find sources of food. With the exception of migratory penguins, travel over oceans is especially difficult as the birds have little refuge unless there is something floating on the water, such as a ship, on which to land. Otherwise they must continue flying until they reach land. Some will not survive the migration due to predators, including man, illness or injury. Although the migrations themselves are done as a community, once the birds reach their respective summer and winter homes, they disperse into family units. And every continent is affected by the migration as every continent is home, at least part of year, to a species of migratory bird. The cameras of Jacques Perrin fly with migratory birds: geese, storks, cranes. The film begins with spring in France and the migration to the Arctic; the flight is a community event for each species. Once in the Arctic, it's family time: courtship, nests, eggs, fledglings, and first flight. Chicks must soon fly south through Europe and North America. Bad weather, hunters, and pollution take their toll. Then, the cameras go south over the Sahara; South Africa is the winter destination. The search for food, good weather, and a place to hatch young takes this annual cycle of stamina across continents and oceans. There is a spare narration and a few titles; for the most part it's visual, a bird's eye view.':  documentary \n",

This year Hef has asked Dylan to create something unique and different.

In the late eighteenth century the young teenage Queen, Marie Antoinette, attended masquerades in Paris as lavish and decadent as any in history. There are many differences between these parties and the Playboy Masquerade. Modern technology, for example, enables today's pleasure seekers to enjoy the very latest in laser light shows, amped up music, chilled cocktails, and VIP transportation.

            "Prediction for title 'Hot-wire your mind and make your wildest fantasies come true. Play with cops, robbers, marines, leather studs and denim clad villains. There's an ambitious setup here and a very clever way of linking scenes, but it gets screwed up a bit by seriously crappy acting (even by porn standards) and a seeming inability by the director to cut to the chase. It starts out with devastatingly cute Tommy Cruise (maybe he's the one that's been having an affair with Kyle Bradford) being rather playfully assaulted by Peter Wilder and Dino DiMarco. Burly leather god, and former Mr. Drummer, Kyle Brandon lumbers by and scares away the baddies. Far from being grateful, Tommy is pissed. You see, he explains, \"it's just a game,\" and disappears. In his place on a barrel in the alley, Brandon finds a card advertising gamemaster.com. Intrigued, Brandon goes home and checks it out, but not before he strips down to his unflattering CK briefs. It takes a long time for Brandon to get into his scene. And while the filmmakers didn't have to build a fake web site to be used in the movie (though I bet they could get people to do it very cheaply these days), anyone with a DVD player is web-savvy enough to know that you'd never go to a web site and have some unseen hand type out 'Welcome to Gamemaster' on the screen. I know I'm being picky here, but it wouldn't be an issue if the director didn't spend an inordinate amount of time showing you the way to get into the site. But with the preliminaries done, and with the donning of a suspiciously handy pair of virtual reality glasses, Kyle is in. He chooses the S/M Leather feature (big shock) and finds himself chained to an enormous X with drooling top man Carl Erik waiting for him. Erik is truly a sight to behold in full leather garb - rock hard muscles and an even harder cock that he has trussed up in a series of leather straps. To my surprise, big and burly Kyle Brandon is a natural bottom and really seems to get pleasure out of being tied up and dominated. Leather and S/M really isn't my thing, but I know enough about it to know that while these two are hot together and get into their toys, it isn't particularly extreme. It seems more like dress-up. But for those with vanilla dreams of leather and tit clamps, the scene will work like a charm. When it's over, we see suit-and-tie office guy Carl Erik on the phone to his buddy Cutter West to tell him about this great site he was just at. Erik should never be given lines other than 'tighten that hole,' since his thick German accent makes everything he says incomprehensible. Erik tells the blonde, slightly balding Cutter about the great new Gamemaster site. After showing us how to get into the site again, and with the use of another pair of VR glasses, Cutter is in. He chose 'Military Maneuvers' where he plays a sergeant who challenges Private J.T. Sloane to a marksmanship contest. Once a lot of dull conversation and dead spots is gotten past, Cutter and J.T. go at it. I've always been a fan of J.T., whose body and look only seems to get better. It was also quite nice to see a thickly muscular guy like him take Cutter's big snake up the ass. J.T. calls up his friend Kyle McKenna, who still seems to be in bed, and tells him about what a great time he had a gamemaster. Kyle decided to check it out. Again, we get to see how to get into the site, but we're coming upon the highlight of the movie, so it's OK. Dark and rippling Kyle chooses 'Cops and Robbers' and he's the cop. He comes home after a long day of work and is surprised by tattooed sex pig Cole Tucker burglarizing his home. In a very sexy and semi-believable way, Cole forces Kyle to strip and gets off on his humiliation. We all know that Cole is a born top man and he doesn't disappoint here as almost splits Kyle in two with his enormous cock and a big, greasy black dildo. In the worst bit of acting in the flick, Cole is then a nerdish computer geek who spends a long time calling his pal, the smooth and boyish bottom Tommy Cruise. Cruise chooses 'Back Alley Thrills' and this one truly cuts to the chase. After being cornered by Peter Wilder and Dino DiMarco, they roughly rip off Tommy's clothes and get right to the fucking. Tommy squeals in delight, or maybe pain, as he takes Dino's enormous salami in the caboose while Peter rams his dewy lips with his king size cock. It's certainly not the best porno out there, but there are definitely reasons to recommend - namely Tommy Cruises' bottom boy enthusiasm and Cole Tucker's tough, top man attitude. All they really need to do was cut out the dead air between and before scenes to make it something truly hot. But then again, that's what the fast forward button is for.':  comedy \n",

In the beginning of the last century, a lot of Jews arrived in Argentina, running away from the attacks they suffered in Europe. In 1919, during a workers conflict known as The Tragic Week, a pogrom was held in Buenos Aires, in the Once neighbourhood. Of that event, it's been said that \"it was done by some well-to-do boys who went out to hunt the kikes\". The film starts with the questions that the director himself, whose grandfather arrived in Buenos Aires in early Twentieth Century, asks himself about that event and its implications. And about the causes and consequences of its scarce spreading, about the distorted facts on the number of people who died and about the internal ideological disputes inside the Jewish Community. The director finds a few stories, allusions in a song, or in a film. But he knows, that in view of the little which is known and remembered, one has to listen, reconstruct, ask, even fictionalize.

            "Prediction for title 'About the Film The collapse of the US banking system in 2008 had been forecasted years before it happened by the people in this film. But no one wanted to listen. Instead our country fell apart in the Fall of 2008, the worst financial collapse in the history of Wall Street. What is naked short selling: It is selling stock in a public company that you do not own and you never deliver to the buyer. Honest people call this stealing. This is done daily by many big banks for themselves and/or their customers. How can this happen in today's environment? 30 years ago stock physically changed hands in person between a buyer and a seller on Wall Street. Today, it is done electronically. In many cases, the stock is sold electronically but never delivered. In essence, our system has trillions of dollars of stock IOU's that will never be collected. What is the scope of the problem? It is the belief of many experts and others that trillions of dollars have been stolen from hard working Americans by selling them counterfeit stock that does not exist. This unscrupulous conduct still exists today. What are the consequences to average Americans of naked short selling? Naked short selling: a) steals money from hard working Americans by selling them counterfeit stock; b) destroys good public companies that have products that can make all American lives better; c) has destroyed millions of jobs by destroying these same companies who's stock is being manipulated. Naked short selling has led to turmoil and unnecessary volatility in our markets worldwide by creating counterfeit shares which have destroyed companies and left wrecked lives in its wake. Big banks and their clients have been incentivized to kill companies rather than build them up as a surer way to profit but these actions also have led to massive disorder in exchanges around the world, threatening our entire financial system. In 2008, rampant fraud on Wall Street created billions of counterfeit shares in the stock market, bond and futures markets, and the credit default swap market, helping to cause the catastrophic collapse of the entire world's economy. Known as naked short selling, the fraudulent practice caused the collapse of hundreds or even thousands of American companies, cost our country countless jobs, decimated retirement funds, and even flooded the market with fake mortgages. The Wall Street Conspiracy chronicles the stories of a small group of activists who worked tirelessly to expose the corruption in our financial markets. Coming from all walks of life, some were entrepreneurs like Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne and Eagletech's Rod Young, others were activists, like Mark Faulk, Darren Saunders, and Dave Patch, economists like Susanne Trimbath and Robert Shapiro, and lawyers Wes Christian and John O'Quinn. They tried to educate investors, Congress, the SEC, and even the President about the imminent danger of allowing this financial terrorism to continue, but their cries fell on mostly deaf ears. This is a story of rampant greed, corruption, and the failure of our government to act to stop it... before it was too late.':  documentary \n",

Eighty years later, Pierre Bayard, a professor of literature and psychoanalyst, offers a fascinating deconstruction of the novel.

The montage re-presented in Kemosabe version 1.0 illustrates how American media, intentionally or not, did and does negatively and inaccurately portray Native Americans, whereas the subtext of Kemosabe version 1.0 illustrates how the \"Lone Ranger\" has subjugated \"Tonto\" as he consumes and assumes \"Tonto's\" \"Indian-ness\".':  documentary \n",

They are the silent witnesses of a bygone era when more than 1200 films were produced under the Nazi regime, depicting a wide array of diverse topics ranging from chest-thumping musicals to anti-Semitic propaganda and melodramas about euthanasia itself. Up to the present time, in Germany, there still exists an ongoing censorship for about 40 films of the Third Reich that were made under the supervision of Joseph Goebbels' ministry of propaganda. Even though some can be concerned as absurd and blatant in our modern societies, they are deemed as dangerous and can be viewed only in special screenings under the presence of an expert, because they can still establish stereotypes to unaware audiences. Without a single doubt, some of those films are actually very well made, yet, disturbingly effective with their minute hints and insinuations cleverly hidden throughout the movie, proving Goebbels' belief that film not only is the means to educate the youth but also the most important part of propaganda. With the help of distinct experts and German film historians, this documentary attempts to provide its viewers with enough stimuli on the debate about the controversial subject of censorship as well as the inner conflict about where one draws the line on such a delicate matter.':  documentary \n",

The interest in inexplicable phenomena is growing, something which can even be measured by the propensity of those unerring trend barometers, the television stations, to broadcast a fill of material of this nature. Paranormal phenomena manifest a remainder from the factual world which cannot be explained. They represent another dimension which requires a \"medium\", be it human or technical, in order to be perceived. The film Paranormal undertakes research in the milieu of borderline science as a parallel activity. The filmmakers seek out experts and amateurs in the field of the supernatural and ask them to explain the methods by which they make contact with the \"cosmic information web\". The necessary apparatus forms the central part of the report. In their search for \"units of sense\" in the chaos, the researchers use, interestingly enough, those techniques which are presently central to popular culture ­ de-construction, sampling and scratching. Parallel to this Lampalzer / Oppermann also undertake their own experiments by various cinematographic means, ranging from single frame photography to a manipulated Super 8 camera.

From concrete illusions of grandeur to round grass covered dwellings under ground. The viewer will meet world famous architects and visionaries like Buckminster Fuller and Le Corbusier and experience their visions and ideas of how to build us a better world. With the help of animations unrealized projects come to life in this documentary that shows astounding visions of a world - as it could have been. Since the end of the 19th century industrialized man has been confronted with new kinds of possibilities and problems, all of which in one way or another are the consequences of a storm of technological progress. Amidst the smoke and wars, architects and artists saw early on that this was a world full of possibilities, with plenty of room for visionary ideas. They were motivated and driven by the problems of the day, be it a shortage of housing, urban decay or pollution. Their visions brought changes in our ways of living and dwelling that challenged our concepts of the good, the true and the beautiful. In this documentary we encounter the Anthroposophist head quarters in Switzerland, the functionalist cities of Le Corbusier and Archigram's projects where pop-art meets architecture. We also meet the self-taught inventor Buckminster Fuller and his light weight constructions, and Antti Lovag - the protector of round houses.

Great Expectations is the first documentary to present the grand architectural visions of our time. Visions where imagination has been allowed to run free. Sometimes unrealized and unbound by earthly conditions, sometimes realized and revolutionary to its inhabitants. But the film deals with far more than mere illusions of grandeur. It is the story of great thinkers who in different time-periods of the 20th century have suggested revolutionary changes to our ways of living - and how it is to live in their dreams. The answers vary, but the intentions of the architects were good - mostly. Using archive footage and animations, the film brings architecture of the past and plans never realized to life.

Farhaan, a law graduate, was brought up with ideals of non-violence and patriotism. Dev unwittingly gives Farhaan the wound that plunges him into rage and violence after witnessing the death of his father during a peace demonstration. Taking advantage of the situation, corrupt politician Latif sets the vulnerable young man on a path of violence and destruction that threatens to ignite the city. Aalyn is the light in Farhaan's life. Beautiful and innocent, the young woman also gets caught in extraordinary circumstances that transform her life and she dares to stand up for the truth. Dev is the saga of Dev and Tej's friendship, a bond stronger than blood ties in which Farhaan emerges as the wedge driving them apart. The story unfolds against the vitiated atmosphere of present times where innocent lives become fodder for political expediency. The spark of terrorist violence unknowingly set off by Farhaan under the aegis of the corrupt politician Latif engulfs the whole city in its flames. Tej transgresses beyond the boundaries of law in his passion to eliminate anti-national crime. Dev is faced with the spectre of the tragic human cost and a moral compulsion to act. The stakes rise beyond self-interest. Dev and Tej are set on a path of dramatic collision. Even as Dev and Farhaan's fate gets irreversibly linked, two soldiers whose allegiance may be to different causes but admiration for each other's courage and integrity brings them together. On a train bound for Bombay from Surat, a Police Inspector questions a young man named Farhaan, who has just obtained his law degree, for his reason to go to Bombay, and whether he has any alliance with Pakistanis. Farhaan answers that he is going to Bombay to live with his father, and he does not know anyone from Pakistan. Farhaan finds out that Bombay Police have been targeting the Muslim community, and in the name of fighting terrorism, have been killing innocent Muslim men, women and children. He comes to know that Joint Commissioner of Police, Dev Pratap Singh, is involved in this witch-hunt, and he would like to kill him. Farhaan joins hands with the local Muslim political leader, Latif, and he is provided training in handling guns, and is subsequently made ready for this task. Unfortunately, Farhaan is unable to kill Dev, who escapes unhurt, albeit a little shaken. Chief Minister Bhandarkar views this incident seriously, and instructs the police to root out terrorist elements in the city, which they do so ruthlessly. Farhaan is told to deliver a package to a man near a Hindu temple, and he does so. While at a stop to buy some snacks, the package explodes, killing several people. Since this incident occurred near a Hindu temple, a right-wing political party member, Mangal Rao, organizes a wave of riots against the Muslim community. Riots take place, and the police are instructed to observe and not prevent the violence. As a result, hundreds are killed. Latif organizes his men to target and attack Hindus and Hindu establishments, rendering the region unsafe, with people being killed in the name of religion. When Hindus and Muslims have had enough, they publicly ask for peace, it is only then Latif and Mangal Rao agree on a truce, on the condition that no Muslim male, female or child will file a FIR (First Information Report) in any police station, to which Latif agrees. Latif then warns everyone in the Muslim community not to complain against anyone. Period. It is then Farhaan finds out that he has been treated as a pawn by Latif, and decides to trust Dev and become an informer. But will Dev trust a man who just attempted to kill him? And will Latif and Mangal Rao join forces to eliminate Farhaan, who now has become a liability to both sides.':  action \n",

She believes that overweight people, like her mom and brother, seem to make excuses about how the world perceives them. So Aly decides to attend a rival high school as a heavily overweight person for the documentary, but not change her personality. Aly intends and hopes to prove that personality will outshine physical appearance. But when she's met with ridicule, harassment, and name-calling she begins to see things differently.

At its heart is the literary work of philosopher James P. Carse, Finite and Infinite Games. Choreographer Katherine Helen Fisher crafted nine dances seeking to explore the individual's role within the community through interweaving narrative and abstract elements of movement. Visual artist, C. Finley, created a massive 12' x 48' non-repetitive geometric backdrop. Finley's artwork simultaneously clashes with and complements the dancers, exposes or hides them as the need arises. Her art is a comparative replication of the dance and a beautiful mirroring of the stained glass at Judson Memorial Church. Designer Gai Mattiolo's costumes are as much a part of the choreography as the dancers themselves. Alternately standing out or blending in, an infusion of colors or muted tones---a merging of high couture and choreography---he has extended the reach of the dancers in a beautiful way. RJ Muna directed the filming. Brought to you by thisiswater Productions, LLC in association with Random Bench Productions. FINITE & INFINITE GAMES is a celebration of unity, color and variety---a riot of pure movement.

            "Prediction for title 'A contemporary comedy about five Anglo-Canadians - actually four Anglos and a New Yorker - who find themselves in a two-week total immersion French program in a remote town in Northern Quebec. The place is perfect for total immersion, since according to the most recent census the population is 97% Quebecois \"pure laine,\" unilingually French, and fervently nationalist. No one is quite sure who or what the remaining 3% is. Following the closure of the plant - the primary economic generator in town - the residents of the small town of St-Isadore-du-Coeur-de-Jésus in central Québec, for their survival as town, reinvent themselves as a community by opening a French language school. The two week program will be fully immersive, where the students are not to speak English or any other non-French language or else be yellow carded, and will be billeted with local families who are to expose them solely to traditional Québecois culture. The program is despite the general animosity the Francophones especially in small town Québec have against their Anglophone counterparts in the rest of the country, the Francophones who view the Anglophones more as curiosities than people. The students will have a difficult enough time remembering who's who as almost everyone in the town has the surname Tremblay. The second class of students includes: Bobby Sexton, incognito as Bobby Smith, an in the closet gay MP for the Completely Canadian Party, he who will be running for the party leadership once the current leader makes the official announcement to step down, and who needs to be able to debate in French against who will be his main rival, Michael Pontifikator; Jonathan Hornstein, a Jewish New York chef trainee, who wants to open a French restaurant; Colin MacGonagle, a mild mannered Red Deer postal carrier; Aretha Marley, a flight attendant who mistakenly believes her French is already good having been in French immersion before, and who has to pass her company's language test this time around to stay employed; and Cathy, a firefighter. Beyond the French-English divide, complications ensue as: Bobby's true identity possibly comes to light, especially as Pontifikator is all over the airwaves; competitive but loving sisters Ginette and Pat, Cathy and Aretha's hosts respectively, argue over who should get who as a billet; Cathy's true profession and her reason for being at the school also possibly comes to light; the divide in Jonathan's host family's household is not French-English but rather Catholic-Jewish; Jonathan finds a kindred soul in South Asian Kumar, a Punjabi restaurateur who moved to town as he was told that's where all the Indians are, and as his arranged marriage bride Amrita won't speak to him as she hates the town; Colin's host parents' adopted twin Asian daughters doing whatever they can to make his life miserable; and Colin becomes more interested in the French language teacher, Julie Tremblay, than he is in the French language itself.

Uppercut In the rematch that followed, Michael was less than four minutes away from taking the world title after knocking his opponent down in the 11th round. But when Eubank rose, with just 20 seconds of the round remaining, he caught Michael with an uppercut. Watson fell, caught his head on the ropes and was eventually left with severe brain damage. Michael was allowed to come out for the final round before referee Francis stopped the bout with the stricken fighter against the ropes taking further punishment.

Small, East Texas towns like Reklaw don't have too many jobs for guys with a brain injury, slight paralysis and an occasional lack of good judgment. And no, in case you were wondering, he ain't retarded. FORWARD/BACKWARD tells the story of Clayton Miles, brain injury survivor and East Texas charmer. Due to a \"vehicular collision at the age of 16,\" Clayton doesn't walk, talk or think like most people. The untimely death of his uncle means Clayton must come home early from brain injury camp and return to his father, Willie, a truck driver who has essentially given up on his own life. When Clayton's best friend, Josh, gets back from the Marines, Clayton couldn't be happier. He's sure the good old days of drinking, chasing girls and philosophizing have returned. But Josh isn't the same guy who left four years ago. He's no longer satisfied with just living in Reklaw, working for minimum wage and spending his money on beer and cigarettes. Josh dreams of Hawaii, of Willie Nelson concerts, of a life beyond this small East Texas town. And ultimately, despite the responsibility he feels for Clayton, his ticket out of Reklaw becomes painfully clear. For Clayton, it seems that an endless series of accidents, funerals, jobs, screw-ups, well-meaning family members, friends and girlfriends are what make up his life. But also humor and poetry and passion. And if that's not enough, Clayton can always have just one more chance, can't he?

As his friends and family grow and change, Clayton remains relatively unchanged. How much of Clayton is his brain injury, and how much is him? Can you even separate the two? Set against the backdrop of a small-town America soon to be rocked by the events of September 11th, the boundary between you and the underworld is only a matter of pumping a little oil, taking a drive down those winding, East Texas roads or signing away your life just for a chance to get out.':  drama \n",
